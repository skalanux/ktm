== The following documentation is taken from the notipy project, and is meant to be changed


ktm (aka kill the messenger!) is an implementation of the http://developer.gnome.org/notification-spec/[Desktop Notification Specification]. It shows
message popups using gtk3, allowing for pango marked up message bodies and icons
that can be specified in various ways.

The design goals of notipy include a minimalistic implementation (following the
unix philosophy "do one thing and do it well") and having as little as possible
dependencies.

== Installation

notipy requires the following libraries to work:

* `gtk3`
* `pygobject`
* `dbus-python`

Installation is simply done via:

----
./deployment/setup.py install
----

== Configuration

Until now, ktm is configured exclusively via command-line arguments. These
can be listed via the `--help` command-line option:

----
usage: notipy.py [-h] [-l {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}] [-t EXPIRETIMEOUT] [-m MARGINS]
                 [-a {NORTH_WEST,SOUTH_WEST,SOUTH_EAST,NORTH_EAST}] [-d {VERTICAL,HORIZONTAL}]

A notification server implementing the specification from http://developer.gnome.org/notification-spec/.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}, --loglevel {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}
                        set the logging level (default: WARNING)
  -t EXPIRETIMEOUT, --expire-timeout EXPIRETIMEOUT
                        set the maximum/default timeout for notifications in [ms] (default: 10000)
  -m MARGINS, --margins MARGINS
                        set screen margins for top, right, bottom and left side of the screen in pixels (default: 0,0,0,0)
  -a {NORTH_WEST,SOUTH_WEST,SOUTH_EAST,NORTH_EAST}, --layout-anchor {NORTH_WEST,SOUTH_WEST,SOUTH_EAST,NORTH_EAST}
                        set the origin for the notifications (default: NORTH_EAST)
  -d {VERTICAL,HORIZONTAL}, --layout-direction {VERTICAL,HORIZONTAL}
                        set the direction for the notifications (default: VERTICAL)
